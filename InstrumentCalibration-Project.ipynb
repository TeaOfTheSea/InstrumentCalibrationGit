    "Measurement is a process of comparison: the measured quantity is compared to a known standard. Before we measure, we must establish the relationship between the readout val-ues of our instrument and known input values of the measurand. This process is called as calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of calibrating a system is to:\n",
    "- Relate the actual sensor output (i.e. a voltage) to the quantity we are attempting to measure ($\\frac{F}{A}$ a normal stress, we usually call pressure)\n",
    "- Identify and correct bias error\n",
    "- Quantify random error associated with using each system. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will develop scripts to calibrate two independent pressure measurement systems: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. an analog gauge and \n",
    "2. an electronic pressure transducer \n",

    "### Background\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Part 1 (due April 30):\n",
    "A report that briefly describes the concrete strength database and how you plan to solve the tasks of creating a suitable data model.  \n",
    "- Break down each task into manageable subtasks and describe how you intend to solve the subtasks and how you will test each task. (Perhaps make a simple Gantt Chart)\n",
    "- Address the responsibilities of each team member for tasks completed and tasks to be completed until the end of the semester. (Perhaps make explicit subtask assignments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your report should be limited to 4 pages, 12 pt font size, double linespacing (exclusive of references which are NOT included in the page count).  You need to cite/reference all sources you used.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2 (due May 7):\n",
    "- A well-documented JupyterLab (using a python kernel) analysis and implementation for the data model.\n",
    "- A well-documented JupyterLab (using a python kernel) implementation for the data model user interface.\n",
    "- A well-documented JupyterLab (using a python kernel) implementation for the database update interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Above items can reside in a single notebook; but clearly identify sections that perform different tasks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A how-to video demonstrating performance and description of problems that you were not able to solve.\n",
    "- A project management video (up to 5 minutes) in which you explain how you completed the project and how you worked as a team.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Above items can reside in a single video; but structure the video into the two parts; use an obvious transition when moving from \"how to ...\" into the project management portion.**  Keep the total video length to less than 10 minutes; submit as an *unlisted* YouTube video, and just supply the link (someone on each team is likely to have a YouTube creator account).  Keep in mind a 10 minute video can approach 100MB file size before compression, so it won't upload to Blackboard and cannot be emailed."

    "### The process of calibrating a pressure transducer\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure transducer is an instrument consisting of a piston on top of which a mass is placed, a chamber filled with oil who's pressure rises as more mass is placed on the piston, a gauge at the end of the oil chamber, a reservoir for the oil, and another piston so as to adjust the system's base pressure. There is also a voltage out, which is based upon the piston pushing on a sensor that outputs the deformation as voltage.\n",
    "The pressure transducer works by taking a mass on the primary piston and converting that to a measure of pressure on the analogue reader and to a voltage value out. Then, the readings of the analogue gauge and the voltage values get compared. The relationship of the values and the readings is determined by finding the coefficients in a linear equation so as to find the best fitting line for all of the data points, which are the readings to the values."

    "### Summarize the value of a calibration (data) model in the context of converting voltage readings to applied pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can not reverse the process by which voltage readings are produced using a pressure transducer. For the physical device, mass used to create pressure is always the input and voltage is always the output. This means we can find the voltage that correlates to any given pressure by simply using the mass needed to create that pressure as an imput, but if we wanted to find the pressure that corresponded to any given voltage, we would be forced to make guesses in a fassion comparable to a binary search. This process would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* X pressure produces a voltage lower than desired, so increase the mass to Y\n",
    "* Y pressure produces a voltage higher than desired, do increase the mass below Y but still above X\n",
    "\n",
    "This process would be incredibly tedious and to find an answer with high percision, the amount of trials needed would be inordinatly large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of going through this process, we can calibrate our system and define the relationship between our input an output as a mathematical model. This model, unlike the real world device it emulates, does not have it's order constrained. Finding a pressure which corresponds to a given voltage is as simple as solving for a variable. This makes calibration an incredibly useful tool for the purposes of converting voltage readings to applied pressure."

    "The graphs below show the correlation between what the gauge shows versus the actual pressure (fig. 1), the voltage value to the actual pressure (fig. 2), and the gauge readings against the voltage values. The data points are arranged rather linearly and consistently, minus a small jump in the low 50s for analogue pressure (as seen on fig. 1 and 3). This could imply that the gauge has an issue in that area of pressure. Additionally, the readings for analogue pressure seem to be less precise, as seen by the fact that at certain point of true pressure, there are mulitple different corresponding analogue values (fig. 1). Voltage meanwhile, seems to be far more precise (fig. 2). This could either be due to user error in reading, or some issue with the gauge- though the first is more likely. All of this also proves the usefulness for repeated testing: If each pressure was only tested once, the likelihood that calibration would be correct is not high. Hence, the repeated tests and the repeats of true pressure."
